Configuring nginx as a proxy
============================

NodeBB by default runs on port ``4567``, meaning that builds are usually
accessed using a port number in addition to their hostname (e.g.
``http://example.org:4567``)

In order to allow NodeBB to be served without a port, nginx can be set
up to proxy all requests to a particular hostname (or subdomain) to an
upstream NodeBB build running on any port.

Requirements
------------

-  NGINX version v1.3.13 or greater

   -  Package managers may not provide a new enough version. To get the
      latest version, `compile it
      yourself <http://nginx.org/en/download.html>`__, or if on Ubuntu,
      use the `NGINX
      Stable <https://launchpad.net/~nginx/+archive/stable>`__ or `NGINX
      Development <https://launchpad.net/~nginx/+archive/development>`__
      PPA builds, if you are on Debian, use `DotDeb
      repository <http://www.dotdeb.org/instructions/>`__ to get the
      latest version of Nginx.
   -  To determine your nginx version, execute ``nginx -V`` in a shell

Configuration
-------------

NGINX-served sites are contained in a ``server`` block. This block of
options goes in a specific place based on how nginx was installed and
configured:

-  ``/path/to/nginx/sites-available/*`` -- files here must be aliased to
   ``../sites-enabled``
-  ``/path/to/nginx/conf.d/*.conf`` -- filenames must end in ``.conf``
-  ``/path/to/nginx/httpd.conf`` -- if all else fails

Below is the basic nginx configuration for a NodeBB build running on
port ``4567``:

::

    server {
        listen 80;

        server_name forum.example.org;

        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4567;
            proxy_redirect off;

            # Socket.IO Support
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
    }

Below is another nginx configuration for a NodeBB that has port:
``["4567","4568"]`` in config.json.

::

    server {
        listen 80;

        server_name forum.example.org;

        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

            proxy_pass http://io_nodes;
            proxy_redirect off;

            # Socket.IO Support
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
    }

    upstream io_nodes {
        ip_hash;
        server 127.0.0.1:4567;
        server 127.0.0.1:4568;
    }

Below is an nginx configuration which uses SSL.

::

    ### redirects http requests to https
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name forum.example.org;

        return 302 https://$server_name$request_uri;
    }

    ### the https server
    server {
        # listen on ssl, deliver with speedy if possible
        listen 443 ssl spdy;

        server_name forum.example.org;

        # change these paths!
        ssl_certificate /path/to/cert/bundle.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/cert/forum.example.org.key;

        # enables all versions of TLS, but not SSLv2 or 3 which are weak and now deprecated.
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;

        # disables all weak ciphers
        ssl_ciphers 'AES128+EECDH:AES128+EDH';

        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4567;
            proxy_redirect off;

            # Socket.IO Support
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
    }

Notes
-----

-  nginx must be on version 1.4.x to properly support websockets.
   Debian/Ubuntu uses 1.2, although it will work there will be a
   reduction in functionality.
-  The ``proxy_pass`` IP should be ``127.0.0.1`` if your NodeBB is
   hosted on the same physical server as your nginx server. Update the
   port to match your NodeBB, if necessary.
-  This config sets up your nginx server to listen to requests for
   ``forum.example.org``. It doesn't magically route the internet to it,
   though, so you also have to update your DNS server to send requests
   for ``forum.example.org`` to the machine with nginx on it!

Configuring Nginx to use a custom error page
============================================

This example will demonstrate how to configure Nginx to use a custom 502
error page when your forum isn't running.

Create your custom error page
-----------------------------

Create a new file ``502.html`` and place it in the
``/usr/share/nginx/html`` directory. This is where Nginx sets its
document root by default. Be sure to add content to your ``502.html``
file. Here's an example which you can copy and paste:

::

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>Insert your page title here</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Insert your content here.</p>
        </body>
    </html>

Configure Nginx to use your custom error page
---------------------------------------------

We now need to tell Nginx to use our page when the relevant error
occurs. Open your server block file
``/etc/nginx/sites-available/default``. If you're using a non-default
server block file, be sure to change ``default``.

::

    server {
        # Config will be here.

        error_page 502 /502.html;

        location = /502.html {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            internal;
        }
    }

The ``error_page`` directive is used so that the custom page you created
is served when a 502 error occurs. The location block ensures that the
root matches our file system location and that the file is accessible
only through internal Nginx redirects.

Restart Nginx ``sudo service nginx restart`` and the next time a user
visits your forum when it isn't running, they'll see your custom page.

SELinux fix
-----------

Type as root:

```
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
```

This will prevent the "bad gateway" error. Tested on CentOS 7.

You may check the current status of this boolean varialbe with this command:

```
getsebool -a | grep httpd_can_network_connect
```
